Work in progress CyanogenMod 7 device configuration for the ZTE Crescent / Blade S, marketed as Orange San Francisco II and T-Mobile Vivacity.

Thanks to flibblesan as I practically lifted this entire thing and hacked up Wi-Fi.
Mostly working thanks to HCDRJacob.
Uses parts of the ZTE Blade configuration with thanks to HCDRJacob and Tom_G.
